## Analyzing proportions  
Proportions give the fraction of the members of a population that possess a particular trait. We express these the same wayas probabilities, from 0.0–1.0.

**The binomial test allows us to determine the probability of an event that has a binomial distribution, meaning that each individual can have one of two possible outcomes** (e.g., success/failure, alive/dead, vertebrate/invertebrate, etc.). We state what we count as a “hit” or a trial with a particular outcome. For example, “What’s the probability that I would have 12 women in a class of 20?” A “hit” here would be observing a woman rather than a guy.

<br>

## The binomial equation  

To calculate binomial probabilities, we use this equation:

Pr[X hits] $=\binom{n}{X}p^{X}(1-p^{n-X})$

Going forward, we'll see that every test as assumptions that have to be true about your data to prevent you from “cheating” the test. The binomial test requires that:

1. the number of trials (*n*) is fixed

2. each trial is independent of every other trial

3. the probability of success (or a “hit”) is the same in every trial 

The hand calculation is a bit of a chore, but the good news is that R has an easy way to calculate the probability of a single event using the function **dbinom()**. It has the general form of 

```
dbinom(n, size, prob)
```

where n is the number of hits, size is the number of trials, and prob is the probability of a hit. Note that the in the hand equation *X* is the number of hits but R uses n. Sorry.

<br>

#### An example

I have a class in which 80% of my students are biology majors and 20% are chemistry majors. I wanted to know if I sampled students from this class, what would be the probability of selecting 2 chemistry majors and 3 biology majors if I selecting them in groups of 5. 

I’ll call getting a bio major to be a hit for the purposes of this example. So, in this case, **p** = 0.8, **n** = 5, and **X** = 3, which gives me this:


```
dbinom(3, size = 5, prob = 0.8)

[1] 0.2048

(Note that R console output leads with the [1]. The result follows the [1] the way that your functions follow the >.)
```


So, I would have about a 20.5% chance of selecting 3 bio majors from this group if I sampled them in groups of 5.

What if I wanted to know the probability of getting 3 or more bio majors in groups of 5? This would be

Pr[3 or more] = Pr[3] + Pr[4] + Pr[5]

So, you could do the **dbinom()** function two more times and sum them:

```{r echo=TRUE}
dbinom(4, size = 5, prob = 0.8)

dbinom(5, size = 5, prob = 0.8)
```

Pr[3 or more] = 0.21 + 0.41 + 0.33 = 0.95. This means that I’d expect to get 3 or more bio majors 95% of the time with repeated sampling.

<br>

Or you could use this: 

```{r echo=TRUE}
# calculate the number of hits from 3 to 5
xsuccesses <- 3:5

# do each calculation
probx <- dbinom(xsuccesses, size = 5, prob = 0.8)

# make a table from those two values
probTable <- data.frame(xsuccesses, probx) 

# display the table
show(probTable )
```


<br>


Following these functions, you could also show the outcomes as a histogram:

<br>


`barplot(height = probx, names.arg = xsuccesses, space = 0, las = 1, ylab = "Probability", xlab = "Number of biology majors“)`


<br>

(I know that we’re using the barplot function to make a histogram, but this works better for binomial data based on the way that we calculated the objects.)

<br>

## Testing hypotheses with the binomial test  

We use the binomial test to calculate the probabilities of a outcome to see if they differ from what we would expect to see by chance. For example:

Over the last 10 years, I have worked with 50 students in my research lab. This year I have 6 but only one is a guy. Is this a fluke? Should I have a more balanced sex distribution in my lab? Looking at my old class rosters, I found that 72% of the students who have taken my classes were women (actual data here, FYI.). So, Pr[guys] = 0.28. Overall, 10 of the 50 students in my lab have been guys.

**Question: Is the sex ratio in my lab (0.20) smaller than the average proportion of guys at Suffolk (0.28)?** Let's use $\alpha$= 0.05 as our rejection level.

**Hypotheses:**

$H_0$: The sex ratio in my lab includes the same or greater proportion of guys than the CAS overall (put another way, Pr[11 or more] ≥ 0.05).

$H_a$: The sex ratio of my lab includes fewer guys than would be expected (or Pr[10 or fewer] < 0.05).

<br>

Adapting the code above:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# calculate the number of hits from 0 to 10
xsuccesses <- 0:10

# do each calculation
probx <- dbinom(xsuccesses, size = 50, prob = 0.28)

# make a table from those two values
probTable <- data.frame(xsuccesses, probx) 

# display the table
probTable 

sum(probx)  # Use this function to sum up those probabilities
```

So, given the proportion of guys at Suffolk <u>I would expect this proportion of guys in my lab (20% or fewer) at least 13% of the time</u>. I fail to reject the null hypothesis because the calculated probability is greater than my confidence level of 0.05. I conclude, then, that my lab’s sex ratio is not significantly different than the sex ratio of students in my classes overall.

<br>

If you don’t need all the individual probabilities for plotting them, there’s an even shorter way to do this test:

```{r}
binom.test(10, n = 50, p = 0.28, alternative = "less")
```

<br>

Notice with this approach:

1. This function does a two-tailed test by default, but I added the argument alternative = “less” to specify that I only cared about 10 or fewer, not 10 or fewer AND 40 or more, which would be the two-tailed test. Refer to the help in RStudio for binom.test() for the arguments.

2. This reports my sample probability as 0.2.

3. This also calculates the 95% confidence interval of the sample estimate for me without any extra work.

<br>

## Sampling distribution of a proportion  

Like any estimate, the sample proportion phat is an estimate of the population proportion p. One upshot of this is that we can calculate the 95% confidence interval. You could calculate the standard error of *p* and the 95% confidence interval by hand, but why should you? R to the rescue!

If you used **binom.test()** as before, you got the 95% CI in the output. Sometimes we need to estimate the parametric proportion, and that requires a fix called the Agresti-Coull method, discussed in Whitlock and Schluter.

To do this the easy way in R, you’ll need to download a package to add to base R. You’ll only need to install this package <u>once per computer</u>. 

```
install.packages("binom", dependencies = TRUE)
```

With that installed, load the package so that you can use its functions. You’ll need to <u>load the package in each R session</u> if you want to use its commands:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Load the binom package
library(binom) 

# calculate the 95% CI
binom.confint(10, 50, method = "ac")
```

<br>

The text refers to the Agresti-Coull method of calculating the 95% CI. The function above does that (using method = “ac”). The 95% CI is different from what we got for my lab example above because it estimates the value of the parametric *p* using the observed data rather than the was we did it above, using 0.28 as the parameter based on previous observations of students in classes.

<br>

If you use it without the method argument, R will return CIs based on 11 different methods. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
binom.confint(10, 50)
```

Why on Earth would you want such a pile of CIs? Each of these methods uses a slightly different algorithm and you might choose one over the other based on your data; or you might want to look for a consensus among different methods if your data are messy.

<br>

## Conclusion


Calculating direct probabilities using the binomial equation is a powerful tool for testing hypotheses for data that are “either this outcome or that one” binomial in nature. (A “powerful” test means that it has a good ability to distinguish real differences from those expected by chance.) Future tests will allow us to do more with observations of nominal-scale variables that are more than yes/no outcomes.
